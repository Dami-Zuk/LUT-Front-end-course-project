Hello there!
My name is Damian Zukowski and I´m a soon-to-be 2nd year ICT student in Turku University of Applied Sciences.
During the first year of my studies I was involved in a group project called Turku Event Hub. 
It was about a portal containing different events and happenings around Turku region and I was responsible for a front-end part. 
From that came my interest in Web Development process.

This repository will contain a front-end focused project called Zukos Brewery! :) 
It´s going to be my second webpage that I´ve done in my career so far, and hopefully it´ll be much more advanced than the first!

Fingers crossed :)
