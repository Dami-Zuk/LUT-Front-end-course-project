Hello there! My name is Damian Zukowski and I´m a soon-to-be 2nd year ICT student in Turku University of Applied Sciences. During the first year of my studies I was involved in a group project called Turku Event Hub. It was about a portal containing different events and happenings around Turku region and I was responsible for a front-end part. From that came my interest in Web Development process.

This repository will contain a front-end focused project called Zukos Brewery! :) It´s going to be my second webpage that I´ve done in my career so far, and hopefully it´ll be much more advanced than the first!

Fingers crossed :)

To run the project simply open the Index.html in your browser and the website will work.

If you want to edit the code, there are additional steps:
1. Download and install Node.js -> https://nodejs.org/en
2. Install Node-Sass by typing "npm install node-sass" in terminal, without quotation marks.
3. Open the terminal in the project folder and type "npm install", without quotation marks.
4. In order to compile .scss code into .css, type "npm run sass" in terminal, without quotation marks.
While saving the .scss file, your code will be compiled into .css.
